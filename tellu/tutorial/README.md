We ran through the tutorial twice, once shortly after it was created and once in September to prepare for testing the approach on TelluCloud code. The second time it ran more smoothly, after the tutorial had been updated to fix issues reported in the initial runs.

We include here the results from botsing-model-generation and evosuite, as well as reports from jacoco and pit. 13 tests were generated, but three failed with exceptions and were not copied to the test suite.
